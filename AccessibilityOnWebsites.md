# Accessibility on Websites



> During this project I researched Accessibility on Websites. 
>
> Using **Express Handlebars, Node.js, Canvas, jQuery and CSS**, I built and designed a petition that was blurry, uncomfortable and user un-friendly. 
>
> The idea was for users to experience the difficulty of registration/log-in, navigation through a site and sign the petition, in an environment that was not weaved to their needs.
